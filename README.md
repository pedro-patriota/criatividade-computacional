# 🎵 Lyrics & Chords Synchronizer

A Streamlit web application that synchronizes lyrics with chord changes in music. Upload your audio file along with lyrics and chord data, and visualize them together with interactive chord buttons.

## Features

✨ **Key Features:**
- 📤 Upload MP3, WAV, or M4A audio files
- 🎼 Upload lyrics and chord timing data (JSON format)
- 🔄 Automatic synchronization of lyrics with chords
- 🎨 Interactive display with chord buttons positioned above lyrics
- 📊 Detailed timeline view
- 📥 Download synchronized results as text or JSON

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Setup

1. **Clone or download this project** to your local machine

2. **Install required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Streamlit app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

The app will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## Usage

### Step 1: Upload Audio File
- Navigate to the "📤 Upload" tab
- Click the file uploader and select an MP3, WAV, or M4A file
- The audio player will appear so you can preview the file

### Step 2: Process Audio Data
- Go to the "🔍 Process" tab
- Upload two JSON files:
  - **Lyrics JSON**: Contains words with timing information (start/end times)
  - **Chords JSON**: Contains chord information with timing

### Example JSON Formats

**Lyrics JSON Format:**
```json
[
  {
    "start": 3.52,
    "end": 9.4,
    "text": "What you see, what you feel, all I give to you is real",
    "language": "english",
    "words": [
      {
        "word": "What",
        "start": 3.52,
        "end": 3.83,
        "score": 0.84
      },
      {
        "word": "you",
        "start": 3.83,
        "end": 3.97,
        "score": 0.97
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Chords JSON Format:**
```json
[
  {
    "start": 0.76,
    "end": 7.09,
    "chord_majmin": "D#:maj"
  },
  {
    "start": 7.09,
    "end": 18.11,
    "chord_majmin": "N"
  }
]
```

### Step 3: Sync and Display
- Click the "🔄 Sync Lyrics with Chords" button
- The app will process the data and create synchronized lyrics
- Navigate to the "🎼 Display" tab to view the results
- Chord buttons will appear above the words at the exact moment they start playing

### Step 4: Download Results
- Use the download buttons at the bottom to save:
  - **Text format**: Simple text with chords embedded in curly braces
  - **JSON format**: Full timing data for further processing

## How It Works

1. **Timeline Alignment**: The app calculates when each chord starts relative to each word
2. **Position Calculation**: For each chord, it determines the character position within the word based on the time offset proportional to the word duration
3. **Chord Insertion**: Chords are inserted into words at the calculated positions
4. **Visual Display**: Chord buttons are positioned above lyrics, appearing exactly when they start

### Algorithm Example

For the phrase: "I love sushi forever" with chords C, A, B:
- If C starts at 0.76s (during "I")
- If A starts at 2.5s (mid-way through "love")  
- If B starts at 4.0s (at end of word before "forever")

Result: `{C}I lo{A}ve sushi fore{B}ver`

## Related Scripts

### `chrodsSync.py`
The core synchronization engine. This script:
- Loads lyrics and chords JSON files
- Extracts timing information for each word and chord
- Calculates proper insertion positions
- Outputs synchronized lyrics with embedded chords

**Usage:**
```bash
python chrodsSync.py
```

Outputs: `lyrics_with_chords.txt`

## Requirements

- **streamlit**: Web application framework
- **librosa**: Audio processing (optional, for future audio analysis)
- **numpy**: Numerical computing (optional, for future audio analysis)

## Tips & Tricks

💡 **Best Practices:**

1. **Accurate Timing**: Ensure your JSON files have accurate start/end times for best results
2. **JSON Format**: Double-check that JSON files are properly formatted (valid JSON syntax)
3. **Chord Naming**: Use standard chord notation (e.g., "C:maj", "G:min", "D#:maj")
4. **Audio Quality**: Higher quality audio files may provide better results if using automatic extraction

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: "Error loading files: ..."
- **Solution**: Verify your JSON files are valid and properly formatted

**Issue**: Chords not appearing in display
- **Solution**: Check that your chord data has `chord_majmin` field and it's not "N" (no chord)

**Issue**: Streamlit app won't start
- **Solution**: Make sure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Future Enhancements

🚀 **Planned Features:**
- Automatic chord detection from audio using machine learning
- Real-time lyrics extraction using Whisper API
- Synchronized playback with visual highlighting
- Support for multiple languages
- Export to various formats (PDF, LRC, etc.)
- Plugin system for custom chord detection models
